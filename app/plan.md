# Plan for Enhancements to the Food Dictate App

## Information Gathered:
- **Home.tsx**: Displays a welcome message and information about the app. It uses a `View` and `Text` components styled with `StyleSheet`.
- **_layout.tsx**: Sets up the root layout with theme management and navigation. It uses a `Stack` for routing and handles the splash screen.

## Proposed Enhancements:
1. **Add a New Feature**: Implement a feature that allows users to input and manage their food preferences.
   - Create a new component for managing preferences.
   - Integrate this component into the existing layout.

2. **Improve User Experience**: Enhance the welcome message with additional information or tips for using the app.
   - Update the `Home.tsx` to include a brief tutorial or guide.

3. **Theme Customization**: Ensure that the theme handling is robust, especially with the missing `useColorScheme` hook.
   - Investigate the implementation of the `useColorScheme` hook and ensure it is correctly integrated.

## Follow-up Steps:
- Review the existing components and identify areas for improvement.
- Implement the proposed enhancements in a structured manner.
- Test the application to ensure all features work as intended.
